  <p>Muslim Festivals
    Islam is one of the world's major faiths. It was established in Arabia in the 7th century CE by the Prophet Muhammad.
    'Islam' is an Arabic word that means surrender. A Muslim is defined as someone who accepts Allah's will and submits to it.
    Allah is regarded as the only God, the world's creator, sustainer, and restorer.
    The sacred books, the Quran, reveal Allah's will, to which all human beings must adhere.
    Ramzan Fasting Dates, Id-Ul-Fitr, Ramzan, Bakrid (Eid-al-Adha), Hijra - Islamic New Year, Moharam, and Miladi Nabi for the Indian Calendar Year is the most prominent Muslim Festivals in India.
    The Islamic Hijri calendar, which is a lunar calendar, is used to determine Islamic festivals.
    Muslim festivals in India are significantly more diverse and enriching due to the social environment.</p>
  <h2>Eid-Ul-Fitar</h2>
  <p>Ramzan is the Muslim holy month of fasting observed by Muslims all over the world.
    Eid-ul-Fitr is a Muslim celebration that takes place at the end of the month of Ramzan.
    Although alms are donated to the impoverished during the month of Ramzan, on the day of Eid, shortly before the Namaz is recited, this tradition is strengthened and alms called ‘Fitra’ are delivered, earning the celebration the name Eid-ul-Fitr.
    Muslims believe that Allah orders His followers to pay 'Zakat' and 'Fitra' before giving Eid prayers of appreciation to Allah, according to the Quran.
    Zakat, which is commonly translated as "the poor-rate," is a specified proportion of one's wealth that a believer is obligated to pay to the needy.
    It is a mandatory duty as one of Islam's pillars. </p>

  <h3>Id-ul-Zuha or Id-ul-Azha</h3>
    <p>Bakr-Eid, or the Id that involves the sacrifice of a goat or Bakra, is another name for this. On the tenth day of Dhu-al-Hijjah, the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar, this is commemorated.
      It commemorates the Prophet Ibrahim's unwavering loyalty to Allah, which was put to the test when God commanded him to sacrifice his son.
      Ibrahim is supposed to have willingly agreed to have his son's head cut off, but God was gracious and accepted the sacrifice of a goat's head.
      As a result, a ram's head is slaughtered on the day of Eid-ul-Azha, and the meat is divided as ritual offerings among family members and neighbors.
      The impoverished receive a third of the sacrificial meat.
      This Eid also marks the start of the sacred month during which many people perform the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca).</p>

      <h4>Milad-Un-Nabi</h4>
      <p>This festival, also known as the Barah-wafat, commemorates the Prophet Muhammad's birth anniversary.
        The Prophet was born on the twelfth day of Rabi-al-Awwal, the third month of the Muslim calendar, according to the Quran. Milad-un-Nabi or Mawlid-un-Nabi is the date of his birth.
        This is also the day that the Prophet is said to have left the planet, hence the celebrations are relatively low-key on this day.
        The day falls within the category of national holidays. It is observed with solemnity and devotion. People flock to mosques to hear the Holy Quran read aloud.
        Religious scholars recite the Qasida al-Burda Sharif, a very sacred poem penned by Arabic Sufi Busiri in the 13th century, at special meetings.
        They also perform Nats, which are traditional poems written in the Prophet's honor and depicting his good actions.
        The event is called Barah (twelve) wafat (death) because it commemorates the Prophet Muhammad's death after a twelve-day illness.
        It is particularly significant in areas like Kashmir, where the Prophet's remains are on exhibit at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar.
        Hundreds of thousands of devotees throng the region to see the procession.</p>
